# ACM-observability

Enables the [multicluster observability feature in ACM](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html/observability/index)

Notice this feature uses an object storage, you'll need to customize how to get a bucket for your specific environment.
